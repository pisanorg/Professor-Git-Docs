# Signing Up for GitHub Education

This guide describes the process for signing up for GitHub Education.
While students have a simpler process, teachers may also sign up for GitHub's Education
discount.

This can waive the cost of an organization with private repositories, so that students can have their work
hosted on GitHub in private repositories that are under your control.

**If you are teaching multiple sections or classes using GitHub Classroom**, it may be easier to create a single
organization for all of your classes, rather than repeating these steps multiple times.
**You can only have one classroom per organization.**

1. Navigate to [education.github.com/discount_requests/new](https://education.github.com/discount_requests/new)

  account.

3. Create a new GitHub organization, if you haven't already.

    - Navigate to [github.com/organizations/new](https://github.com/organizations/new)

    - Fill out the form. Choose the _"Free"_ plan. You won't need to supply payment information.

    - You can skip the remaining steps.

    - Go back to the _"Discount Request"_ page, and refresh the page.

4. Select the organization that you would like to use. All of your student's assignments will appear under this org.
You'll want to specify that this is for a classroom.

5. Fill in information about the class. Since each student will need their own private repo for each assignment,
you should estimate that you need around 100 private repositories per section of a class. This is where the assignment submissions will
be stored.

6. Fill in this contact information, including your `@uw.edu` e-mail address.
  
Submit the request. Hearing back from GitHub may take some time, so be sure to do this in advance, before the class
actually starts.
